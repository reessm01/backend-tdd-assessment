# TDD - Creating a cmd line tool

For this assessment, We'll be using the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD) to created a modified version of the `echo` command line tool:

In doing so, you'll be demonstrating a basic understanding of the following:

- Converting acceptance criteria into unit tests using
  [unittest](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/unittest.html)
- Employing [Test Driven Development (TDD)](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/learning-to-test-with-python-997ace2d8abe) to write a program that conforms to those criteria
- Parsing command line argumens with [argparse](https://docs.python.org/2.7/howto/argparse.html#id1)
- Commonly used [string methods](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods)

## Getting Started

TDD _starts_ with setting up a test harness, and writing the tests FIRST, before writing application code. Think of the test cases that you will need for the `echo` application that you will build. For a small project like this, it's sufficient to have a single test case named `test_echo.py`. In the beginning, all tests should fail (of course, because you haven't written anything!) However, you are proving out the basic execution paths and setup of your program.  
Pay special attention to the name of the test module: `test_echo.py`. When writing test modules, start each module filename with the prefix `test*`. Many testing frameworks are set up to _auto-discover_ test modules that adhere to this naming convention. Auto-discovery is important-- in a continuous integration environment, your tests will be discovered an run when you attempt to push changes to the repo. Some CI/CD pipelines will not allow you to push changes to the repo, if they cannot auto-discover and run your tests.  
Finally, your application code will reside in the `echo.py` file.

When done, you should have a project directory that looks something like this:

```
.
├── CODEOWNERS
├── README.md
├── USAGE
├── echo.py
├── screenshots
│   └── result.gif
└── tests
    ├── __init__.py
    └── test_echo.py
```

Even before you write a single test, you might find it useful to try out your test harness. Note the use of the `rerun` helper utility. You can PIP-install this useful tool that watches directory for file changes, and re-runs the command each time it detects a saved edit. VSCode IDE also has [built-in unit test discovery](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/unit-testing), but you must manually enable it.

```bash
$ pip install rerun
$ rerun "python -m unittest discover"
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### Step 1: Display Help

When the user provides invalid options or supplies the `-h/--help` flag, the
program should print the following usage message:

    usage: echo.py [-h] [-u] [-l] [-t] text

    Perform transformation on input text.

    positional arguments:
        text         text to be manipulated

    optional arguments:
        -h, --help   show this help message and exit
        -u, --upper  convert text to uppercase
        -l, --lower  convert text to lowercase
        -t, --title  convert text to titlecase

The following unit test can be used to check that your program prints a properly formatted help message:

```python
def test_help(self):
    """ Running the program without arguments should show usage. """

    # Run the command `python ./echo.py -h` in a separate process, then
    # collect it's output.
    process = subprocess.Popen(
        ["python", "./echo.py", "-h"],
        stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
    stdout, _ = process.communicate()
    usage = open("./USAGE", "r").read()

    self.assertEquals(stdout, usage)
```

### Step 2: Test the `-u/--upper option`

Write a unit test that asserts that `upper` get stored inside of the
namespace returned from `parser.parse_args` when either `"-u"` or `"--upper"`
arguments are passed.

It should also test that `"hello"` gets turned into `"HELLO"` when the
program is run.

### Step 3: Test the `-l/--lower option`

Write a unit test that asserts that `lower` get stored inside of the
namespace returned from `parser.parse_args` when either `"-l"` or `"--lower"`
arguments are passed.

It should also test that `"Hello"` gets turned into `"hello"` when the
program is run.

### Step 4: Test the `-t/--title option`

Write a unit test that asserts that `title` get stored inside of the
namespace returned from `parser.parse_args` when either `"-t"` or `"--title"`
arguments are passed.

It should also test that `"hello"` gets turned into `"Hello"` when the
program is run.

### Step 6: Test for when all options are provided

When a user provides all three options, they should be applied in the order
listed in the helpful usage message that Argparse constructs from the argument definitions. Here are a few examples:

```console
$ python echo.py -tul "heLLo!"
Hello!
```

```console
$ python echo.py -ul "heLLo!"
hello!
```

Note that the order that the options are provided doesn't matter, e.g. '-tul' and '-utl' and '-lut' are all equivalent inputs to Argparse. Only the final text transform result should be printed.

### Step 7: Test for no arguments

Write a unit test that asserts that when no arguments are given, the program
returns the unaltered input text.

### Step 8: Implement the program

Now that your tests are complete, implement the program so that the above
tests pass.

## Structuring your code

Remember to separate functionality in your echo.py application. Notice that many of the tests above are checking to see if the argument parser has done its job correctly by parsing out an option from the command line, and making it available in parser output (the Namespace, or parsed args dict).  
Therefore, it makes sense to have a function in echo.py whose sole purpose is to deliver back a parser object, that can be stored in your TestEcho class and invoked by calling its parse_args() method with various argument lists. Such a function might be named `create_parser()`.
You may also benefit from having a separate `main()` function in your echo.py appliction. A main() function can be invoked from the command line directly, as well as be imported by your test program and tested independently.
